### 20. When would you choose a document-oriented database for implementing a new application?

Document databases are schema less, which means they are well suited in the starting face of development of an application as you do not always know the complete data model before hand, and in a relational database it would take a total restructuring of a relation in order to implement changes, where a document database has no schema, so you can fill what ever you want in a document and store it in a collection. 

Further more the document database is focused on creating a simple way of managing horizontal scaled stores, so in an application where you need to store a lot of various data then a document database is a good idea. In the likes of social applications where you have a lot of different types of information like, profile data, news feeds, discussion forums etc. - here you could easily create a collection for each information type and scale it as the application gets bigger. The document database does not supply ACID rules, so the data stored is not always up-to-date on each of the nodes they are stored on. But this is not a problem on a social network, as the data is 'not' that important to have right away. But for a bank application this would not work.
