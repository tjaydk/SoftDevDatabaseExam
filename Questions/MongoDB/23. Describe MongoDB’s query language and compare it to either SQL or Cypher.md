### 23. Describe MongoDBâ€™s query language and compare it to either SQL or Cypher.

Basic CRUD operations in SQL, Cypher and MongoDB

#### SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM table;
SELECT a1, a2 FROM table;
INSERT INTO table VALUES(a1, a2);
UPDATE table SET a1 = new_val WHERE a2 = "something"
DELETE FROM table WHERE a1 = "something"
DROP TABLE tablename
CREATE [UNIQUE|FULLTEXT|SPATIAL] INDEX index_name ON table (attribute) [USING BTREE|HASH]
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table WHERE a1 = "something"
```

#### CYPHER

```cypher
MATCH (node: Node {a1: "something"}) RETURN node;
CREATE (node: Node {a1: "something"})-[relation: Relation {r1: "other thing"}]->(node2: Node);
MATCH (node: Node {a1: "something"}) SET node.a1 = "something else";
MATCH (node: Node {a1: "something"}) DELETE node;
CREATE INDEX ON :Node(a1) / DROP INDEX ON :Node(a1)
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (node: Node) ASSERT node.a1 IS UNIQUE
PROFILE MATCH (node: Node)-[:RELATION]->(node1: Node) WHERE node.a1 = "Something"
```

#### MongoDB

```javascript
db.collection.find({name: "something"})
db.collection.insert({name: "something"})
db.collection.update({name: "something"}, {$set {name: "something else"})
db.collection.remove({name: "something"}, {justOne: true})
db.collection.drop()
db.collection.createIndex({attribute: 1})
db.collection.find({...}).explain()
```

MongoDB uses documents in both insertion and filtering, so everything has to be created as object documents. This goes for the java mongo client as well as for the c# mongo client, which makes querying with these connectors very tedious. Here you can see a querying with a mongoDB connector in C#

```c#
collection.Aggregate()
                .Match(new BsonDocument { { "polarity", 4 } })
                .Group(new BsonDocument { { "_id", "$user" } })
                .Limit(5)
                .ToList();
```

So instead of using just the javascript syntax you have to create a new BsonDocument for filters and objects.
