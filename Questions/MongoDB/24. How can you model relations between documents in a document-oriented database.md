### 24. How can you model relations between documents in a document-oriented database?

Just like with a relational database that uses referential keys to determine referred data, you can use references in an document database as well. Normally you would just embed the data, which would cause repetition of data, but would make the performance of querying much faster. But could result in data inconsistency, if data was updated some places, but not all places. 

To avoid this you can create different collections eg.

- A Book collection
- An Author collection

Here you would then store the author data one time for each author, and then reference the author id in the book, or vice versa - depending on the amount of data in each collection, storing the reference in which collection is determined of the amount of references having to be stored in the array of the object. In this case it would be best to store the author id with the book, as there would usually only be one author.

But differently to the relational database you will not be able to do a join of collections, so in order to query through the relations you would have to find the object in the first collection, retrieve the objectid for the second collection, then retrieve the object from the second collection and in some way pick out the information needed.
