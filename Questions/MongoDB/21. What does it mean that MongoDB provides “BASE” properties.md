### 21. What does it mean that MongoDB provides “BASE” properties?

BASE means:

- **Basic availability** The store appears to work most of the time.
- **Soft-state** Stores don’t have to be write-consistent, nor do different replicas have to be mutually consistent all the time.
- **Eventual consistency** Stores exhibit consistency at some later point (e.g., lazily at read time).

So this means that it values availability over consistency, so it works as a loose store where the ACID rules don't apply. It works well for setting up a horizontally scaled store, but does not supply guarantee that the data is consistent on all of the nodes, but at some eventual time it will reach consistency. So this type of store model works well with a application that serves data like tweets, or other types of data that does not need to be totally up to date, but at some point will be there. But where you will have to store a lot of data which should be reachable pretty fast.

This is not a suited store for vital data like in a bank transaction application or the like.
