### 26. Describe different strategies to model tree structures in a document-oriented DB.

You can use tree structures to create a hierarchical or nested data relationship.

There are a few different ways of modeling tree structures in a document database like MongoDB. These are the following types of tree structures supported in MongoDB:

- The Child References pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores in an array the id(s) of the node’s children.
- The Parent References pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, the document stores the id of the node’s parent.
- The Array of Ancestors pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores in an array the id(s) of the node’s ancestors or path and a reference to the parent.
- The Materialized Paths pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of the node’s ancestors or path.
- The Nested Sets pattern stores each tree node in a document; in addition to the tree node, document stores the id of node’s parent, the node’s initial stop in the left field, and its return stop in the right field.

Here is an example of how to store using a child references pattern in MongoDB:

```javascript
db.categories.insert( { _id: "MongoDB", children: [] } )
db.categories.insert( { _id: "dbm", children: [] } )
db.categories.insert( { _id: "Databases", children: [ "MongoDB", "dbm" ] } )
db.categories.insert( { _id: "Languages", children: [] } )
db.categories.insert( { _id: "Programming", children: [ "Databases", "Languages" ] } )
db.categories.insert( { _id: "Books", children: [ "Programming" ] } )
```
