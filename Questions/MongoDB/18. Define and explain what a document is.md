### 18. Define and explain what a document is.

A document in MongoDB is a BSON document, or binary JSON which is an object that consists of key, value pairs where the value can be simple data types like int, string, boolean etc. and complex data types like arrays or even other BSON documents.

Here is an example of a BSON document:

```javascript
{
  _id: objectID("0b8c73c27c83"),
  name: "Hans",
  age: 28,
  has_license: true,
  hobbies: ["tennis", "gaming"]
}
```

As you can see this resembles a JSON document, besides the fact that a JSON document would have had the quotes around the key's as well.

A BSON document can hold all the information you like, and is not limited by a schema on the collection. But to resemble a relational database you could have multiple collection and then instead of hobbies you could have the _id objectID referenced in the hobbies collection or vice versa. In this particular case it would not make sense.
