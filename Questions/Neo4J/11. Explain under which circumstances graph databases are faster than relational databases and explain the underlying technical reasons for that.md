### 11. Explain under which circumstances graph databases are faster than relational databases and explain the underlying technical reasons for that

So when working with data that is heavily dependent on the relationship having attributes for themselves it is better to use a graph database. In cases where you want to go in depth with relationships, eg. find a friend, of a friend, of a friend - above depth of 4, or find the shortest path going through multiple nodes a graph database outperforms the relational database.

This has to do with the general algorithms working with a graph database. As it builds on the same concept as graphs in general with nodes and edges, being either uni- / or bidirectional with the edges counting as a separate object by itself, which can have values like weights - used f.ex. with the pagerank algorithm. This makes path finding much more feasible on a graph rather than a relational database. Where the relational database will need to join relations, even selfjoin - which then will create a cartesian product which is the number of tuples in relation a * the number of tuples in relation b. Where the graph database will start at a given node and then following the edge head node traverse through the graph in an either depth first or breadth first search, using algorithms as Dijkstra's (only supported by the Rest API of Neo4J) goes for extremely fast ways of determining shortest paths, or just paths in general.
