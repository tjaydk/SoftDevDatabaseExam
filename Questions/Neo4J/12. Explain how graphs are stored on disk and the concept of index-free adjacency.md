### 12. Explain how graphs are stored on disk and the concept of index-free adjacency

Graphs are stored on the disk in a way that nodes are stored next to their adjacent nodes and relationships, thus ensuring that when traversing through the graph each node and relationship is easily found, and you would only have to search the disk in an extend of the part of the graph being searched. This is also called native processing. Graphs that use global indexes are called non-native processing databases as they rely on an index like a relational database instead of using a more native graph theory data structure.

Every node has a pointer only to its first relationship, this relationship then has a pointer to the next and so on an so forth. Once we have reached the relationship that we searched for we then have the possibility to retrieve either the tail, which is the node we started from or the head, the node that this relationship goes to.
