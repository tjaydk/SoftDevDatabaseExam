### 13. Name and explain different types of indexes in Neo4j

Indexes are a redundant copy of data stored in the database which makes traversal through data faster, these indexes can be either stored in a BTree (binary trees) structure or a Hash structure, which calculates the hashcode of the attribute and stores it either in a array with linked list under each hashcode or in a array being filled by calling next until the array is 80% filled.

Neo4j can create either indexes on a single property called single property index or on multiple properties, which is called composite index - much recognized from the relational world of keys and composite keys.

Differently to many relational databases the indexes are automatically managed and kept up to date.

This is how you create a single property index:

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(firstname)
```

 Here we create a composite index

```cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(firstname, surname)
```

If a node or relationship has more than one index you can run into the problem that the query planner chooses the wrong index, in this case you can give what is called a planner hint by adding the ``` USING``` clause to the query:

```cypher
MATCH (liskov:Scientist { name:'Liskov' })-[:KNOWS]->(wing:Scientist)-[:RESEARCHED]->(cs:Science { name:'Computer Science' })<-[:RESEARCHED]-(conway:Scientist { name: 'Conway' })
USING INDEX liskov:Scientist(name)
RETURN liskov.born AS column
```

This will not work if you have stated a ``` START``` clause.

If you use a composite index you will have to state all attributes in the ``` WHERE``` clause separated by the ``` AND``` clause. Other statements that can use the indexes are:

```cypher
MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE person.firstname IN ['Andres', 'Mark']
RETURN person

MATCH (person:Person)
WHERE person.firstname STARTS WITH 'And'
RETURN person

MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE exists(p.firstname)
RETURN p
```

All of the above is only supported by the property index, and not the composite index.
