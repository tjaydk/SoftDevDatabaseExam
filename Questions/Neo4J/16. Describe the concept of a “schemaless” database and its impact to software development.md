### 16. Describe the concept of a “schemaless” database and its impact to software development

Schema's are used in relational databases where each relation has a specific schema stating constraints like data type / domains constraints, keys / referential constraints, etc. Each of these 'rules' has to be obeyed when writing to the database, or else it will throw an exception rolling back the transaction.

In graph databases like Neo4J and document databases like MongoDB you do not conform to such schema. Here you can store whatever, whenever without having the database restrict the transaction. This is a very useful thing in the beginning of a development face. Especially on agile applications where the data model will almost guaranteed change and evolve over time. In a relational database this will cause you to have to restructure the database and alter tables etc. where in a schema less database you can just start storing the data in a different way until you find the right solution for the structure and then update the other information accordingly. This has a major impact on the creation of prototypes and can also help with systems that are likely to change in the future.
