## 8. What are idempotent Cypher queries and how to identify them?

An **idempotent query** is a query that you can run several times, and the result of the query will not change between the queries. It specifically applies to queries that cause changes in the database; you wouldn't describe a **match** as idempotent, as there is no situation wherein a **match** would change anything.

An example of an **idempotent query** is the difference between **Create** and **Merge.** **Merge** is an idempotent version of **Create,**  where running a **Create** script several times will add a new record every time, whereas **Merge** will create the new record the first time, and then perform no action if you run the query again. **Basically**, **an idempotent query is a query that can be applied several times without changing the result beyond the initial application.**

Other operations that are idempotent are **Set** and **Remove.** If you try to add a label to something that already has that label, nothing happens, and if you try to remove a label from something that does not carry that label, nothing happens.
