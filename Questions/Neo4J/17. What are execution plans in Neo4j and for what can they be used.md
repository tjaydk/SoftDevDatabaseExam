### 17. What are execution plans in Neo4j and for what can they be used

Exection plans in Neo4J are the same as for other database systems. Its a way of viewing how a query is executed, whether it will use indexes for seeks or scan the whole graph to find particular data. So in order to see the execution plan of your query you have to use the ``` PROFILE``` clause at the beginning of your query. This will then show you the execution plan used to perform the query. If you eg. see that the plan uses  ```NodeByLabelScan``` this means that the whole graph is being searched, even when the data you wanted to find was found, it will still keep searching giving you a performance of O(n). So in this case you should add an index if the query is one that is ran often as this will change it to a ``` NodeIndexSeek```

Seeks are searching through either a BTree or a hashtable which will increase the query time to be O(log n) or O(1).
