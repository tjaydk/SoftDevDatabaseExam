### 03. How can graph databases be leveraged to implement recommender systems?

A recommender system is a system that relies on predicting the ratings and preferences for a subject to other objects. Eg. Netflix makes use of movies you have watched to recommend other movies that are in the same category. This is one of the applications which Neo4J is suited to apply to, as it is a graph database and can have given edges from the different nodes - and making path finding a easy task to overcome.

Consider the scenario that a 

```cypher
(user: User {name: "Dennis"})-[:WATCHED]->(movie: Movie {genre: horror})<-[:INSTRUCTED_BY]-(instr: Instructor)
```



Here we can see that the user has watched a horror movie by a specific instructor. We could then

```cypher
MATCH (movies: Movie {genre: "horror"})
WHERE NOT (movies)-[:WATCHED]-(:User{name: "Dennis"})
RETURN movies
```



find all movies that are of genre horror which the user hasn't seen yet, or find all movies by the instructor regardless of the genre.

```cypher
MATCH (movies: Movie)-[:INSTRUCTED_BY]-(:Instructor {name: "Steven Spielberg"})
WHERE NOT (movies)-[:WATCHED]-(:User{name: "Dennis"})
RETURN movies
```

So this is the case of finding movies that match the preferences of a users genre or instructor - but could easily be customized to work with ratings or things like that.
