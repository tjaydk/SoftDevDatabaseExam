### 14. Describe why and when graph databases are useful and explain typical use cases

Graph databases are useful in applications where the relationship is key, the graph emphasizes the importance of the relationship between two entities(nodes) by storing it separately. So in applications where this is a key factor a graph database will be a good choice for data persistence. This is f.ex in applications like Social Networks, where the relationship between people is key. It could be in a movie application where you would like a rating system that will connect a user to movies that he might be interested in. It could also be in more native graph theoretical applications, such as stock exchange system where you would like to find negative cycles in a graph - this can be done in wighted graphs. If you are able to find such negative cycles you can trade on it which is called arbitrage.

Any other application that uses path finding is good with graph databases.
