## 5. Compare Cypher to SQL, what are main differences between the languages?

Cypher and SQL are both **declarative languages**, but Cypher has a more visual aspect to it than SQL. SQL relies entirely on descriptive operators, building a 'sentence' describing the operation you're performing. Cypher also has some declarative operators, such as Match and Start, but also heavily relies on encapsulation to give a representation of the operation in an almost visual manner.

Whereas SQL has you describe the relations you're searching through by their names exclusively, Cypher has a pattern referred to as the ()-[]-() pattern, however you pronounce that. Whereas SQL would have you write something like;

```
SELECT movie 
FROM user 
WHERE user.id == 1 
AND user.has_seen == true;
```

Cypher would have you instead trace the relational path from the user to the movie.

```
Start user=node(1)
Match (user)-[:HAS_SEEN]->(movie)
Return movie;
```

This means you're starting from the specific user you want to analyze, and then travel from that user out to all movies connected to that user, where the relationship is marked as HAS_SEEN. It's reminiscent of how you would draw a relationship in a graph.

Cypher also differs from SQL in that you do not start off by searching through all records in a table and keep those that match, as with a Selection; instead, **you choose a specific node to start at**, and then move from there. It's a lot more efficient in finding specific single records, and then moving from there.
