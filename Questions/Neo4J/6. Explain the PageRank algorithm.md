## 6. Explain the PageRank algorithm and for what it can be used with regards to graph databases.

The **PageRank algorithm** WAS an algorithm used in Google for ranking which pages will be shown first on the results page. The idea is that instead of just prioritizing the pages that mention the search word the most, or have the most in-links, it instead focuses on and prioritizes the pages with the most links to it from high-quality sites, which are determined by being linked to by other high-quality sites, recursively.

The PageRank algorithm functions like this:

**PR(p)** = PageRank of a page, p.

1 - d is the **random surfer model.** It's the probability in which a random person will be surfing through links, and click a link on the current page instead of just starting over at a new page. In the example we were given, d = 0.85, so basically a 15% chance of starting over. So it's `0.15 / N`, then we plus that with 0.85 * the sum of **PR(ini) / C(ini)**. 

**ini** is the collection of pages that link to **p.** **PR(ini)** is the PageRank of all of those pages, gauging just how high-quality they are, and then dividing that result by **C(ini),** which is the number of out-links from the pages that link to **p.**

Google has basically indexed the entire WWW as a directed graph, wherein every page is a node, and the directed relationships can be used for the in-links and out-links. You can add the PageRank as a property to every node, and through the graph structure, take the pages that you want to take into considerations, and then look at all relationships and their heads and tails going to and from that node.
