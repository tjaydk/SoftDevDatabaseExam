# Relational Database

## Explain the relational model

Relational data model is the primary data model, which is used widely around the world for data storage and processing. This model is simple and it has all the properties and capabilities required to process data with storage efficiency.

### Concepts

#### Table

In a relational data model, relations are saved in tables. This format stores the relation among entities. A table consists of rows and columns, where a row is representing a record in the table, and a column is representing an attribute.

#### Tuple

A tuple defines a single row of a table, which implements a single record for that relation. In mathematics, a tuple is an ordered list of elements. Related to this is an n-tuple, which in set theory is a collection (sequence) of "n" elements. Given this, it might be more properly said that tuples are implemented as records even though the terms are commonly used interchangeably.

#### Relational schema

A relation schema describes the attributes and constraints of the relation. It is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the relation. 

#### Relational instance

The total set of records in a single relation in a relational database represents a relation instance. In other words, the relational instance of a relation is the data that is present in a single relation at a specific point of time.

#### Key constraints

Each row has one or more attributes, known as relation keys.  A relation key is used to uniquely distinguish one row from another in the relation. In theory, when choosing a primary key for a relation, the procedure is to first define a set of *super keys*, then from that set of *super keys* we define a set of *candidate keys*, and then we select our *primary key* from that set of *candidate keys*.

##### Super Keys

A super key is a field or a combination of fields in a relation which can uniquely identify a row or record. A table can have many super keys, and these should be seen as candidates for being candidate keys.

##### Candidate keys

A relation may contain several super keys that can be identified as candidate keys. Super keys that are not used as the primary key, and contain no extraneous information to the relation can be identified as candidate keys.

##### Primary key

A candidate key that is selected to uniquely identify a row or record in a relation, is known as a primary key. In theory, the candidate key that can be constructed of the least number of attributes and which is less likely to change in the future should be used as the primary key.

#### Referential integrity Constraints

Referential integrity constraints work on the concept of Foreign Keys.

##### Foreign keys

A foreign key is a reference to an attribute with the primary key constraint, usually in another table. Foreign keys provides what we call referential integrity. Referential integrity is a property of data which, when satisfied, requires every value of one attribute to exist as a value in another attribute in a different (or the same) relation. In other words, any column in a base table that is declared a foreign key can contain either a `NULL` value or only values from a parent table's primary key or a candidate key. When a foreign key value is use, it must reference a valid, existing primary key in the parent table.

For instance, deleting a record which contains a value referred to by a foreign key in another table would break the referential integrity. This would either require us to cascade the deletion onto the records which contains a value referred to by a foreign key in another table, or return an error. Which method is used may be determined by a referential integrity constraint. Some few examples are:

- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` *(default in OracleDB and MySQL)*
- `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `ON DELETE SET NULL`

#### Domain constraints

##### What is an attribute domain?

Every attribute has some pre-defined value scope, known as *attribute domain* (nowadays more commonly referred to as a *type* or *data type*). The *attribute domain* defines the possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set. The character string *ABC*, for instance, is not in the `INT` domain, but the integer value *123* is. 

##### Built-in attribute domains:

There are many built-in attribute domains. The SQL-92 standard supports a variety of build-in domain types: `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `INT`, `SMALLINT`, `NUMERIC(p, d)`, `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT(n)`, `DATE`, `TIME`.

##### Custom attribute domains:

The SQL-92 standard also supports defining our own domains. In the below example, we create a domain called `gender`, which can be a single character of either "M" or "F", and then we create a table where we define an attribute called `person_gender` with the `gender` domain.

```sql
CREATE DOMAIN gender CHAR(1)
CONSTRAINT gender_test
CHECK(VALUE IN ("M", "F"));

CREATE TABLE person (
  person_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  person_name VARCHAR(50),
  person_gender gender
);
```
