## 22. Explain reduction to relational schemas. (Mapping.)

Mapping regards the reduction of an ER diagram into a relational schema model. Basically it means taking the graphical representation of a database from an ER diagram, and designing the structure of the relational schema from that diagram. 

For each entity set in an ER diagram, we create a schema corresponding to that entity set. For example, if we have the following entity set:

![b0a9de84694123cb916ef728b0cd32d0](https://i.imgur.com/KKVqZTA.png)

we want to reduce this to a relational schema. Being that ID is underlined, we know that ID is supposed to be the Primary Key of the entity set. Being that it is the primary key of the entity set, it is also the primary key of the relation schema.

`student (ID, name, tot_cred)`

#### Complex/Multivalued Entity Sets

When you use complex/multivalued attributes in an ER diagram, those attributes must be decomposed into several attributes, as normalization rules deem that we cannot have multiple values in one attribute. For example, if we have an ER diagram with a comoposite attribute called *name*, we'd have to decompose that attribute when putting it into the schema, creating the attributes *first_name*, *middle_name* and *last_name*.

If we create a schema from an entity set that contains just a single-valued attribute Primary Key, and a composite attribute, we do not create a second schema to house the multiple attributes and refer to them through a foreign key. Instead, we create just the single schema, containing the primary key attribute, and the attributes inside of the composite attributes, then creating a composite key through the primary key attribute and all other attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a tuple, creating a *superkey.*

For example, if we have an entity containing only a composite attribute, *time_slot_id,* which contains the attributes *day, start_time* and *end_time*, we create a single table with the following structure:

`time_slot (time_slot_id, day, start_time, end_time)`

And in this table, we create a composite key of the original primary key *time_slot_id,* and the attributes *day* and *start_time*, as we can surmise that there can't be more than one time slot taken at the same starting time on the same day.

#### Weak Entity Sets

When mapping a weak entity set into a relational schema, you need to both consider the weak entity set, and the strong entity set on which the weak set is dependent. If we say we have a weak entity set A and a strong entity set B, and A consists of a set of attributes;

` {a1,a2,...,am} `

and entity set B contains a Primary Key that consists of attributes;

`{b1,b2,...,bn}`

then to map the weak entity set A, we create a relation schema called A, which consists of a union between the attributes in A, and the attributes of the primary key of B:

`{a1,a2,...,am} âˆª {b1,b2,...,bn}`

What this means is fairly simple: Mapping a weak entity set to a table requires creating a table with all attributes in the weak entity set, as well as all attributes included in the primary key of B, with a foreign key constraint reference to B. This way we ensure that every tuple in A is represented by a strong entity.

For example, we can have two entities: Weak entity *OrderItem* and strong entity *Order*. *OrderItem* contains the attributes; 

`{item_id, item_name, price}`

and the strong entity Order has a primary key consisting of one attribute:

`order_id`

To create a schema for *OrderItem*, we must create a schema with attributes for *item_id, item_name* and *price*, along with an attribute *order_id*, carrying a foreign key constraint referencing the *Order* schema, creating a schema:

`OrderItem(item_id,order_id,name,price)`

With this table, we then create a primary key on the weak entity set *OrderItem* containing the foreign key referencing *Order,* which is *order_id*, along with the discriminator in the weak entity set. In this case it would be *item_id*, as it can be used to tell every tuple apart from the others. The discriminator of a weak entity set is also called a **Partial Key**, which then can be turned to a primary key with the addition of the foreign key referencing the strong entity set.

#### Relationship Sets

A binary relationship set is a relationship set between two entity sets - meaning the collection of all relationships between two entity sets. When choosing a primary key for a binary relationship, the choice is influenced by the type of relationship present.

**Many-to-many**: For these relationship sets, you perform a union of the primary key attributes between the two entity sets, creating a primary key from those.

**One-to-one:** For these relationship sets, you can choose either of the primary keys arbitrarily. It's not important which primary key you choose.

**Many-to-one/One-to-many:** For these, the primary key on the entity set that's placed on the **many** side of the relationship serves as the primary key. For example, if we have a **one-to-many** between *Order* and *OrderItem,* where one *Order* can have many *OrderItems*, you choose the primary key on *OrderItems.*

For ternary relationship sets, meaning a three-way relationship set, or anything above that, the choice hinges on whether the relationship has arrows drawn on its edges. If there are no arrows, the primary key is the Union of all primary keys. If there is an arrow, then the primary key is the one held by the entity set not connected to the arrow.

For example, let's say we have two tables;

`'instructor' with primary key 'ID'`

`'student' with primary key 'ID'`

Creating a binary relationship set between these two entity sets, would create a relationship set:

`instructor_student(i_ID,s_ID)`

This is a **many-to-many**, where the union of the primary keys is the new primary key. In mapping, this creates a **junction table.**
