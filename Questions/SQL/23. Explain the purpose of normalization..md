## 23. Explain the purpose of normalization.

Normalization becomes relevant when you have a data model wherein there is a certain amount of redundancy. For example, if you have a certain attribute that gets repeated in several tables, you run the risk of inconsistency and loss of data integrity. An example of this is if you have two different tables wherein the home address of an employee is saved. You may run into situations where you need to update that employee’s address, but forget to update it in all attributes wherein it’s kept, creating inconsistent data.

Redundancyin this case is also a waste of space, especially in very large datasetswherein eliminating even just a single column of data can free a significantamount of space.

The main issue with a lack of normalization, as stated in the Database System Concepts book, is an *inability to represent certain information*. This means being unable to save certain data without either introducing unnecessary data, or introducing null values. For example,if instead of having two tables, *department* and *teacher*, we instead have a single table called *faculty*. In this case, we cannot introduce a new department unless that department has a teacher assigned to it; otherwise, we need to set null values in the columns that represent a teacher.

All in all, it wastes space, creates increased complexity when updating values, risk of integrity loss, and representational issues.
