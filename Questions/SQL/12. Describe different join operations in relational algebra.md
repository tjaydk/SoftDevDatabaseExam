## 12. Describe different join operations in relational algebra

Læs Nicolai's noter om algebra.

Joins allows users to establish connections among data in different relations. 

There are many different join operations. We begin by looking at Natural join. A Natural Join Natural join (⋈) is a [binary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation) that is written as (*R* ⋈ *S*) where *R* and *S* are [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_%28database%29).

**natural join**

Natural-Join,⋈, is equal to NATURAL JOIN in SQL. It is similar to UNION, but wherein instead of inserting the values into the same attributes, creates a table containing the attributes of both relation sets.This means you can describe it as a sort of Cartesian Product of the two relations, but with forced equality between the attributes, and removal of duplicates. 

​									**(instructor ⋈ teaches)**

Taking this equation, we are performing a Natural Join on instructor and teaches. This means that the attributes of instructor and teaches are combined into one table,wherein the tuples are only combined on those relations in which their shared attributes are comparable. 

For example, if we say that instructor and teaches have one attribute in common,ID, then only the tuples wherein the ID values match will there be made a new tuple of the combined attributes of the two relations. This means it combines each matching pair of tuples into a single tuple on the union of the two schemas.

The mathematical proof for Natural Join is fairly complicated in length, but could be useful to know in order to fully understand its function:

This can be explained as: A Natural Join between r and s is the Projection of R UNION S,wherein r.A1 is equal to s.A1, r.A2 and s.A2 and so on, from the Cartesian Product of r and s.

**CROSS join - INNER join - Cartesian product**

The Cartesian Product, X, is comparable to the SQL operator CROSS JOIN, or an INNERJOIN wherein the JOIN condition always evaluates to true, or is absent. The Cartesian Product takes two relations, and then creates a tuple for every possible pair of values. Meaning if two relations r1 and r2 have a number of values n1 and n2, then the number of values in the Cartesian product is n1 * n2.

This creates a lot of data, most of it being likely unusable for practical purposes,so X is often used with σ operators to qualify the statement.Say we want every Physics instructor and the course_id for every course they’ve taught, we can CROSS JOIN those two tables, and with SELECT operators qualify the relations we want.

This will result in a Cartesian Product, wherein we want only the tuples where dept_name is Physics, and where the instructor ID is present in the course, meaning we only want instructors that have taught a course in Physics.
