### 8. Authorization

We can grant specific authorizations to users to limit their options when working with and on the database. These authorizations include:

- Authorization to read data.
- Authorization to insert new data.
- Authorization to update data.
- Authorization to delete data.

Theses kinds of authorizations are called privileges. These privileges can be all. none or a combination of the above. The top level of privileges are granted to the administrator or superuser, who can pass on or revoke privileges for other users.

To grant privileges you use the grant statement:

```sql
GRANT <privileges>
ON <relation name or view name>
TO <user/role list>

eg.
GRANT insert ON department TO Emil, Nicolai;
```

In the above example we give the users Emil and Nicolai insert permissions on the department relation. You can further specify specific attributes to grant permissions to.

Here is a list of privileges you can add in SQL.

``` ONsql
GRANT update(budget) ON department TO Ebbe;
```

This grants update rights only on the budget attribute of the department relation to user Ebbe. You can use ``` public``` instead of a user name to grant the privilege to all existing users and future users.

```sql 
REVOKE insert ON department TO Emil, Nicolai;
```

The above statement revokes the permissions given to insert on the department relation for the users Emil and Nicolai.

As it would be tedious in many cases to grant privileges to every user in a specific group you can use roles instead. This makes it possible to group users and grant or revoke privileges for that group.

Below is an example on how to create a role and grant the role to a specific user.

```sql
CREATE ROLE instructor;
GRANT select, insert ON takes TO instructor;
GRANT instructor TO Rune;
```

You can grant multiple roles to a user and you can also grant a role to an existing role, which then would make that role inherit the permissions from the role granted to it.

Besides giving permissions to relations, attributes and procedures you can also give permissions to views, which can give you the ability to future distinguish which data can be accessed.

By default a user or role that is granted a permission does not have the permission to transfer their permission to other users, but you can use the ``` WITH GRANT OPTION``` statement, which allows for such transferring of privileges. The users who creates a relation has privileges to pass on permissions to other users.

When revoking privileges to certain users or roles, if these users has passed on their privilege to other users, these users privileges will also be revoked. So there is a chain retained by the database that ensures revocation is cascading, thus making sure that a user who has granted another user privileges, if that users privileges are revoked, then the second user will not be able to pass the privilege back to the grantee as his privileges are revoked too. You can add the ``` RESTRICT``` statement to prevent this cascading revocation behavior. If a SQL database does not cascade revocation by default you can add ``` CASCADE``` to ensure cascading.

To avoid revoking privileges to users, when a specific users privileges are revoked - eg. when a dean leaves the university, you would not want the instructors, which privileges were granted by the dean, to loose their permission. To ensure this you can pass the privileges as a role, to make sure that its only in the case that the roles privileges are revoked that it will cascade. To do this you can add the ``` GRANTED BY <user>``` clause.
