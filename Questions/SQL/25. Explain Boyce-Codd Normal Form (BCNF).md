## 25. Explain Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

> A relational schema R is considered to be in **Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF)** if, for every one of its dependencies α → β, one of the following conditions holds true:
>
> - α → β is a [trivial functional dependency](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/functional-> dependencies) (i.e., β is a subset of α)
> - α is a [superkey](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/on-keys) for schema R
>
> Informally the Boyce-Codd normal form is expressed as “*Each attribute must represent a > > > fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.*”

BCNF, or 3.5NF, is a normalization form that posits that that a set of functional dependencies F, that for all functional dependencies F+, wherein F+ means the *closure* of the functional dependencies F, of the form     α -> β, where both α and β are subsets of R, then either α is a superkey, or α -> β is a trivial dependency, meaning that β is a subset of α.

When `you` say that β is a subset of α, it means that the relation(s) in β are also part of α. For example, AB -> B is a trivial functional dependency, as B is a subset of AB, because B is in there.

 A *superkey* is a set of columns that can uniquely define a row. A *candidate key* is a *superkey* with the least amount of columns required to be uniquely identifiable. A primary key is usually just the candidate key.

If we want to decompose a schema that is not in BCNF, we must decompose it into two schemas, following this rule:

`(α ∪ β )`
`(R − (β − α))`

Wherein α and β are the nontrivial functional dependency α --> β that causes the original schema to not fulfill BCNF. So we create a schema that's a Union of those two, and a schema that consists of the entirety of the original schema, R, minus β minus α, meaning we remove all columns in β that are not subsets of α.

If we say we have a table such as this:

`inst dept ( ID , name, salary, dept_name, building, budget)`

And we have a functional dependency:

`dept_name -> building, budget`

Then we would have α = dept_name, and β = {building,budget}. We would then decompose the table inst_dept into:

`(α ∪ β) = (dept name, building,budget)`
`(R − (β − α)) = ( ID , name, dept name, salary)`
