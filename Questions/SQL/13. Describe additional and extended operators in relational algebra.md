## Additional and extended operators

Additional and extended operators are operators added to the relational algebra that does not impose any additional mathematical expression power. The computed result of the operation of an extended operator can be composed using the basic relational operators - however the process is far more comprehensive, and for simplicity's sake the following extended operators have been added:

- Sorting
- Duplicate elimination
- Grouping
- Aggregation
- Generalized projections
- Outer join
